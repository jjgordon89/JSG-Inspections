### ‚ùå Critical Issues Identified

## 1. Application Won't Start (Blocking Issues)

### Missing Store Barrel Export
**Severity:** Critical - Application fails to compile

**Issue:** Multiple components import stores from `'./store'` or `'../store'`, but `src/store/index.js` is missing.

**Affected Files:**
- `App.js`: `import { useUIStore, useEquipmentStore, useInspectionStore } from './store';`
- `EquipmentList.js`: `import { useEquipmentStore } from '../store';`
- `InspectionForm.js`, `InspectionList.js`: Similar imports

**Impact:** Application will fail to compile due to unresolved module imports.

### Missing Middleware Implementation
**Severity:** High - Tests fail, documented features unavailable

**Issue:** `src/store/middleware.js` is missing despite being referenced in tests and documentation.

**Impact:** Cross-store communication logic is unavailable, tests fail.

### Electron Development Server Configuration
**Severity:** Medium - Poor development experience

**Issue:** Electron always loads `file://build/index.html` instead of `http://localhost:3000` during development.

**Current Code:**
```javascript
const startUrl = `file://${path.join(__dirname, '../build/index.html')}`;
```

**Impact:** No hot reload, developers can't see live changes during development.

## 2. Data Integrity Issues

### Database Backup/Restore Path Mismatch
**Severity:** High - Data loss risk

**Issue:** Database is created in `app.getPath('userData')` but backup/restore uses `app.getAppPath()`.

**Impact:** Backups don't target the actual database, leading to potential data loss.

### Missing Database Columns
**Severity:** High - Data not persisted

**Issue:** `inspections` table lacks `summary_comments` and `signature` columns used by the application.

**Code Evidence:**
```javascript
// InspectionSummary.js saves these fields
summary_comments: summaryComments,
signature: signature,

// But schema in database.js doesn't include them
CREATE TABLE inspections (
  // ... missing summary_comments and signature columns
)
```

**Impact:** Critical inspection data (comments and signatures) is not persisted.

### Foreign Key Constraints Disabled
**Severity:** Medium - Data integrity risk

**Issue:** SQLite foreign keys are not enabled, allowing orphaned records.

**Impact:** Potential data inconsistencies, especially in compliance management.

## 3. Functional Bugs

### Equipment Document Linking Bug
**Severity:** High - Feature broken

**Issue:** `AddEquipmentForm.js` uses incorrect property for linking documents.

**Problematic Code:**
```javascript
const newEquipment = await window.api.run('INSERT INTO equipment...'); // Returns { lastID }
// Later:
await window.api.run('INSERT INTO documents...', [newEquipment.id, ...]); // Should be newEquipment.lastID
```

**Impact:** Documents are not properly linked to equipment.

### Inspection Form UX Issues
**Severity:** Medium - Poor user experience

**Issues:**
1. First section doesn't open by default due to bug: `setOpenSection(formattedSections.title)` should be `formattedSections[0].title`
2. Deficiency details UI is incomplete (priority, component, notes, photos)
3. Photo annotation integration is unused despite imports
4. Callback wiring prevents refresh/toast feedback after saving inspections

### Template System Inconsistency
**Severity:** Medium - Build failure risk

**Issue:** `checklists.js` imports `./customTemplates.json` which doesn't exist.

**Impact:** Build may fail; template selection logic is inconsistent between database and static files.

## 4. Workflow and UX Gaps

### Incomplete Inspection Workflow
**Current State:** Users can start inspections but cannot:
- Enter detailed deficiency information (priority, component, notes)
- Capture and annotate photos for deficiencies
- See proper feedback after saving inspections

### Missing Error Handling
**Issue:** Database operations lack try/catch blocks, leading to silent failures.

### Unused Dependencies
**Issue:** `react-query` and `react-router-dom` are installed but not used, adding unnecessary bundle size.

## Recommended Fixes (Prioritized)

### üî¥ Critical Priority (Must Fix to Run)

1. **Create Store Barrel Export**
   ```javascript
   // src/store/index.js
   export { default as useUIStore } from './uiStore';
   export { default as useEquipmentStore } from './equipmentStore';
   export { default as useInspectionStore } from './inspectionStore';
   ```

2. **Fix Electron Development URL**
   ```javascript
   const isDev = require('electron-is-dev');
   const startUrl = isDev ? 'http://localhost:3000' : `file://${path.join(__dirname, '../build/index.html')}`;
   ```

3. **Fix Database Backup/Restore Paths**
   ```javascript
   const dbPath = path.join(app.getPath('userData'), 'database.db');
   ```

4. **Add Missing Database Columns**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE inspections ADD COLUMN summary_comments TEXT;
   ALTER TABLE inspections ADD COLUMN signature TEXT;
   ```

5. **Fix Equipment Document Linking**
   ```javascript
   const result = await window.api.run('INSERT INTO equipment...', [...]);
   const insertedId = result.lastID; // Use lastID, not id
   ```

### üü° High Priority (Data Integrity)

1. **Enable Foreign Key Constraints**
   ```javascript
   db.run('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON');
   ```

2. **Fix Inspection Form Callback Wiring**
   - Ensure `onInspectionAdded` is called after saving
   - Fix first section opening bug
   - Wire proper refresh/toast feedback

3. **Resolve Template Import Issue**
   ```javascript
   let customTemplates = {};
   try { 
     customTemplates = require('./customTemplates.json'); 
   } catch (e) { 
     // File doesn't exist, use empty object
   }
   ```

### üü¢ Medium Priority (UX and Features)

1. **Complete Deficiency Details UI**
   - Add priority dropdown (Critical, Major, Minor)
   - Add component text field
   - Add notes textarea
   - Integrate photo capture and annotation

2. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Add try/catch blocks around database operations
   - Show user-friendly error messages via toast

3. **Clean Up Dependencies**
   - Remove unused `react-query` and `react-router-dom` or implement their usage

## Security Assessment
