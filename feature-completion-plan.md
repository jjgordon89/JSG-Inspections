- All date operations should use consistent ISO format handling

### Testing Strategy
- Test each backend operation independently before UI integration
- Verify user context flows through all components correctly
- Test complete workflows with realistic data scenarios
- Validate audit trails capture all required information

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard displays accurate, real-time metrics for all system components
- [x] All user actions are properly attributed and logged
- [ ] Complete workflows function from start to finish without manual intervention
- [ ] System handles error conditions gracefully without crashes
- [ ] All compliance features (load tests, calibrations, credentials) function properly

**Total Tasks:** 41  
**Estimated Completion:** 5-7 weeks (depending on complexity of user authentication implementation and reporting system)

This comprehensive plan provides a clear roadmap to transform the JSG Inspections application from its current state into a fully functional, production-ready CMMS system. The plan now addresses all identified gaps including security vulnerabilities, technical debt, missing backend operations, incomplete workflows, and reporting capabilities.
