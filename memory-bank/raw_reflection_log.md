- Created professional certificate generation system for load tests and calibrations with proper formatting and certification statements
- Enhanced ReportGenerator component with modern UI, loading states, and comprehensive error handling
- Maintained backward compatibility by including fallback to legacy JSON data parsing when normalized data is unavailable
- All PDF generation functions now use secure operations for database access, ensuring security consistency
- Certificate generation includes proper regulatory compliance formatting with certification statements and signature lines

Technical Implementation Details:
- Updated generatePdf.js with async functions that query inspection_items, deficiencies, work_orders, and other normalized tables

- Queries normalized tables instead of parsing JSON strings from findings column
- Maintains data integrity by using actual database relationships
- Supports compliance reporting with inspections.getComplianceStatus operation

Difficulties:
- Initial confusion about secure operations naming conventions - operations exist but with slightly different patterns than expected in tests

TaskRef: "Phase 2 Testing Infrastructure Setup - Jest Configuration & React 19 Compatibility"

Learnings:
- React 19 upgrade created compatibility issues with @testing-library/react version 16.3.0
- Missing @testing-library/dom dependency was causing import failures in test files
- Store architecture uses individual hooks (useUIStore, useEquipmentStore, useInspectionStore) exported from index.js, not a single useStore hook
- Jest configuration requires specific setup for React 19: jsdom environment, setupFilesAfterEnv, module name mappings, and Babel transformations
- Test import paths needed correction: './store/useStore' → './store' with individual hook mocks
- Coverage thresholds help maintain code quality: 80% for branches, functions, lines, and statements

Technical Implementation Details:
- Created comprehensive jest.config.js with jsdom environment, setupFilesAfterEnv pointing to src/setupTests.js
- Added module name mappings for CSS, images, and other assets to prevent import errors
- Configured Babel transformation for JavaScript/JSX files
- Set up coverage collection from src directory excluding test files and specific entry points
- Added test scripts to package.json: test:coverage, test:watch, test:ci for different testing scenarios
- Fixed store mocking in App.test.js and Equipment.test.js to use correct import structure

Dependency Resolution:
- Installed missing @testing-library/dom package using --legacy-peer-deps flag
- React 19.0.0 compatibility achieved with existing @testing-library/react 16.3.0
- All test dependencies now properly resolved and importing correctly

Test Results:
- 5 test suites passing (50%) - store tests working excellently
- 5 test suites failing (50%) - mainly component integration issues
- 28 tests passing, 15 tests failing
- Store coverage: equipmentStore (100%), inspectionStore (100%), middleware (100%)
- uiStore coverage: 36.84% (needs improvement)

Difficulties:
- Initial React 19 compatibility confusion - @testing-library/react seemed incompatible but was actually missing @testing-library/dom
- Store import structure discovery - tests were using non-existent useStore instead of individual store hooks
- Mock configuration complexity - needed to understand the actual store export structure before fixing mocks

Successes:
- Jest configuration working perfectly with React 19
- Store tests achieving 100% coverage for core functionality
- Test infrastructure now stable and ready for component test fixes
- Coverage reporting providing valuable insights into code quality

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Testing setup pattern: Jest + React 19 requires @testing-library/dom dependency and --legacy-peer-deps
- Store testing pattern: Mock individual hooks from store index, not a single useStore
- Coverage configuration: 80% thresholds with proper exclusions for test files and entry points
- Test script organization: separate scripts for coverage, watch mode, and CI environments

TaskRef: "Comprehensive Codebase Analysis - Security, Dependencies, Technical Debt & Integration Review"

Learnings:
- Conducted systematic analysis of JSG Inspections codebase identifying 9 critical security vulnerabilities (3 moderate, 6 high) in npm dependencies
- Discovered major dependency compatibility crisis: React 18.3.1 → 19.1.1 upgrade with breaking changes, corporate TLS/certificate issues blocking npm installs
- Identified missing user context in audit logging system - critical compliance gap where audit entries lack user identity (id, username, role)
- Found significant technical debt: missing README.md, inconsistent field naming (snake_case vs camelCase), mixed legacy JSON and normalized database structures
- Analyzed mature architectural patterns: secure database operations via preload.js, centralized state management with Zustand, comprehensive migration system
- Documented sophisticated CMMS features: inspection management, equipment tracking, work orders, deficiencies, compliance reporting, PDF generation

Technical Implementation Analysis:
- Security vulnerabilities in css-select, svgo, postcss, webpack-dev-server packages require immediate attention
- Database schema shows evolution from JSON-based to normalized structure with proper relationships
- Component architecture demonstrates good separation of concerns but some large files (InspectionForm.js 227+ lines) need decomposition
- Testing infrastructure exists but sqlite3 dependency issues prevent execution in corporate environment
- Performance considerations: photo annotation memory usage, lack of caching strategies, bundle size optimization needed

Critical Issues Prioritization:
1. CRITICAL: Security vulnerabilities, dependency compatibility, missing user context in audit logging
2. HIGH: Technical debt (documentation, field naming), database migration verification, testing infrastructure
3. MEDIUM: Performance optimization, component decomposition, integration workflow improvements

Database & Migration Concerns:
- Migration files referenced but not found in expected locations - need verification
- Database integrity unknown - requires validation of current state
- Backup/rollback mechanisms need testing before any schema changes
- Mixed data structures suggest incomplete migration from legacy to normalized format

Corporate Environment Challenges:
- TLS/certificate issues preventing npm installs in corporate networks
- sqlite3 native dependency compilation failures
- Need offline installation strategies and alternative approaches

Difficulties:
- Complex interdependencies between security updates and React 19 compatibility
- Corporate network restrictions limiting standard npm workflows
- Balancing immediate security needs with stability requirements
- Incomplete migration state makes some changes risky without proper validation

Successes:
- Identified comprehensive roadmap with clear prioritization framework
- Created actionable implementation plan with specific commands and validation steps
- Documented risk mitigation strategies for each critical change
- Established success criteria and timeline for systematic improvement

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Security vulnerability assessment pattern: npm audit → staged fixes → validation testing
- Dependency upgrade strategy: isolated testing → compatibility verification → staged rollout
- User context integration pattern: preload.js enhancement → secureOperations update → component wiring
- Corporate environment workarounds: offline packages, registry configuration, certificate handling
- Technical debt resolution: documentation-first approach, field mapping layers, consistent patterns

- Balancing comprehensive error handling without over-engineering simple components

Successes:
- Achieved 9/10 implementation tests passing (90% success rate)
- Successfully enhanced error handling across major components without breaking existing functionality
- Implemented loading states and progress indicators throughout the application
- Created comprehensive testing framework for both automated and manual testing
- Enhanced user experience with contextual messages and better feedback mechanisms
