# Active Context

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-15  
**Current Phase:** Phase 2 - Testing Infrastructure & Component Optimization

## Current Work Focus

**Phase 1 Security & Stability - COMPLETED ✅**

All critical infrastructure issues have been successfully resolved:

- ✅ Security vulnerabilities addressed (npm packages updated)
- ✅ Dependency compatibility crisis resolved (React 19, Electron upgrades)
- ✅ User context audit logging implemented
- ✅ Documentation created (comprehensive README.md)
- ✅ Field naming consistency implemented (snake_case ↔ camelCase mapping)

## Recent Changes

### Security & Dependencies
- React upgraded from 18.2.0 to 19.0.0 successfully
- Electron upgraded to latest version
- Created `.npmrc` configuration for corporate environment compatibility
- Updated npm packages: css-select, svgo, postcss with `--legacy-peer-deps`
- Application builds and runs without errors

### Audit Logging Enhancement
- Enhanced `preload.js` with comprehensive user session management
- Implemented automatic user context capture (userId, username, ipAddress, userAgent)
- Added `createAuditLogEntry()` and `createWithContext()` functions
- Verified database schema includes proper `users` and `audit_log` tables

### Field Mapping Layer
- Implemented bidirectional field conversion functions in `preload.js`
- Added automatic snake_case ↔ camelCase conversion in `createIPCWrapper`
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive `README.md` with full project overview
- Documented security features, installation procedures, database structure
- Included user roles, support information, and licensing details

## Current Testing Progress (Phase 2)

### Testing Infrastructure - IN PROGRESS ⚠️

**Jest Configuration & Dependencies:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive `jest.config.js` with proper test environment setup
- ✅ Fixed React 19 compatibility issues with @testing-library/react
- ✅ Resolved missing @testing-library/dom dependency
- ✅ Fixed store import path issues (useStore → useUIStore, useEquipmentStore, useInspectionStore)

**Test Suite Status:**
- ✅ 5 test suites passing (50%)
- ⚠️ 5 test suites failing (50%)
- ✅ 28 tests passing
- ⚠️ 15 tests failing
- ✅ Store tests working well (100% coverage for equipmentStore, inspectionStore, middleware)

**Test Coverage Highlights:**
- Store layer: 71.42% overall coverage
- equipmentStore.js: 100% coverage
- inspectionStore.js: 100% coverage
- middleware.js: 100% coverage
- uiStore.js: 36.84% coverage (needs improvement)

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Remaining Test Failures**
   - Scheduler component tests (mock data loading issues)
   - Component integration test failures
   - Improve uiStore test coverage

2. **✅ Security Vulnerabilities Resolved**
   - npm audit now shows 0 vulnerabilities
   - Dependency updates completed successfully

3. **✅ CI/CD Pipeline Implementation - COMPLETED**
   - GitHub Actions workflows created (.github/workflows/ci.yml, release.yml)
   - ESLint configuration implemented (.eslintrc.json)
   - Electron Builder configuration added (electron-builder.json)
   - Package.json updated with lint, electron-pack, and build scripts
   - Audit CI configuration created (.audit-ci.json)

4. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - 137 ESLint issues identified (8 errors, 129 warnings)
   - Primary issues: React import statements and console.log usage
   - Auto-fix capabilities available for most warnings

3. **Component Architecture Optimization**
   - Review and optimize React component structure
   - Implement performance monitoring
   - Address any technical debt in UI components

### Current Considerations

**CI/CD Implementation:**
- Automated testing pipeline configured for pull requests and main branch
- Multi-platform Electron builds (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Security scanning integrated into CI pipeline
- Release automation with GitHub Actions
- ESLint code quality checks enforced

**Performance Baseline:**
- Application builds successfully and runs without errors
- Need to establish performance benchmarks for optimization work
- Monitor memory usage and startup times

## Active Decisions & Patterns

### Established Patterns
- **Corporate Environment Setup:** Always use `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true`
- **User Context Integration:** Automatic capture in all audit operations
- **Field Mapping:** Transparent conversion layer for database-UI consistency
- **Staged Upgrades:** Test compatibility before committing to major updates
- **Documentation First:** Create comprehensive docs during implementation

### Technical Preferences
- Use `--legacy-peer-deps` for npm operations in corporate environment
- Implement user context automatically in audit logging
- Apply field conversion transparently in IPC wrapper
- Maintain backward compatibility during infrastructure changes

## Project Insights

### What Works Well
- Staged approach to major dependency upgrades minimizes risk
- Automatic user context capture ensures compliance without developer overhead
- Transparent field mapping eliminates naming inconsistency issues
- Comprehensive documentation supports team onboarding and maintenance

### Lessons Learned
- Corporate network TLS issues require specific npm configuration
- React 19 upgrade was less disruptive than anticipated with proper preparation
- Field naming inconsistency can be resolved at the API boundary
- Documentation created during implementation is more accurate than post-hoc docs

### Risk Mitigation
- Always test builds after dependency updates
- Document breaking change risks before applying security updates
- Maintain fallback mechanisms during infrastructure changes
- Verify database integrity after schema modifications

## Current Status Summary

**Phase 1 Results:**
- ✅ Application builds and runs successfully
- ✅ No breaking changes from React 19 upgrade
- ✅ User context audit logging fully functional
- ✅ Field mapping works transparently
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation created
- ⚠️ 9 npm vulnerabilities remain (require `--force` - Phase 2 priority)

**Ready for Phase 2:**
The application is now on a stable foundation with modern dependencies, comprehensive audit logging, consistent field mapping, and thorough documentation. Phase 2 can focus on testing infrastructure, remaining security updates, and performance optimization.
