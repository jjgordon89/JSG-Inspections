- Migration system with 5 completed migrations
- Tables: inspections, equipment, documents, users, audit_log, certificates
- Proper indexing and foreign key constraints

**Electron Application:**
- Main process with secure IPC communication
- Preload script with secure operations API
- Renderer process with React-based UI

3. **Audit Compliance** - User context logging fully functional
4. **Data Consistency** - Field mapping layer eliminates naming issues
5. **Documentation** - Comprehensive project documentation created

### 🎯 Current Focus
**Transition Period:** Phase 1 → Phase 2
- Evaluating remaining security vulnerabilities
- Planning testing infrastructure implementation
- Preparing for controlled security updates

### ⚠️ Known Issues

**Security:**
- ✅ npm audit vulnerabilities resolved (0 vulnerabilities found)
- Risk assessment completed for dependency updates

**Testing:**
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline infrastructure implemented
- Manual testing only for critical workflows
- ESLint configuration created (137 linting issues identified for future resolution)

**Code Quality:**
- 137 ESLint issues identified (8 errors, 129 warnings)
- Primary issues: React import statements and console.log usage
- Auto-fix capabilities available for most warnings

**Performance:**
- No performance benchmarks established
- Memory usage and startup time not optimized

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Key Decision Points

**Dependency Management Strategy:**
- **Initial:** Standard npm install approach
- **Evolved:** Corporate environment requires `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps`
- **Rationale:** TLS interception and peer dependency conflicts in corporate networks

**Audit Logging Approach:**
- **Initial:** Basic audit logging without user context
- **Evolved:** Automatic user context capture with session management
- **Rationale:** Compliance requirements and operational transparency

**Field Naming Strategy:**
- **Initial:** Mixed snake_case (database) and camelCase (UI) causing inconsistency
- **Evolved:** Transparent conversion layer at API boundary
- **Rationale:** Maintains database conventions while providing consistent UI experience

**Security Update Strategy:**
- **Initial:** Apply all security updates immediately
- **Evolved:** Staged approach with risk assessment for breaking changes
- **Rationale:** Balance security improvements with application stability

### Lessons Learned

1. **Corporate Environment Considerations:** Always account for network restrictions and TLS interception
2. **Staged Upgrades:** Major dependency updates require careful testing and compatibility verification
3. **User Context Integration:** Implement audit logging with user context from the beginning
4. **Documentation Timing:** Create documentation during implementation for accuracy
5. **Field Mapping:** Address naming inconsistencies at the API boundary rather than throughout the codebase
