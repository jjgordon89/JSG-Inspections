## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Code Splitting Architecture

```javascript
// Lazy loading implementation
const Dashboard = lazy(() => import('../components/Dashboard'));
const EquipmentList = lazy(() => import('../components/EquipmentList'));
const InspectionForm = lazy(() => import('../components/InspectionForm'));

// SuspenseWrapper for consistent loading states
<SuspenseWrapper>
  <Component />
</SuspenseWrapper>
```

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Performance analysis commands
npm run performance-monitor  # Detailed analysis
npm run analyze:webpack      # Visual bundle analysis
npm run analyze:full         # Complete pipeline
```

### Security Monitoring

```bash
# Security check commands
npm audit                    # Check vulnerabilities
npm audit --audit-level=info # Detailed security info
npm outdated                 # Check package updates
```
